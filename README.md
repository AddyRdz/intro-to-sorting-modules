# Intro to Sorting Algorithms

This lesson is an introduction to the concept of sorting in computer science, including sorting methods, stability, and how Big O comes into play for sorting.

## Instructions
1. Follow along the steps in this README to progress through the myGA modules.
1. When you are finished, submit your assignment by clicking on the "Issues" tab above this repo to start a new issue.
1. The issue template will ask that you answer a number of exit ticket questions before submitting your issue, to summarize your learning on this topic.


>Note: The myGA module links to a coding exercise on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/GAmarketing/pen/xMeqaN?editors=0010#0). 

For tonight, focus on understanding these sorting algorithms conceptually. Do try out the provided coding exercises, as they will help you with your understanding. However you are not required to complete them as part of this deliverable.

## Overview

There are a few components to this lesson, in the following order:

1. [myGA module: Intro to Sorting Algorithms](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/818)
1. [myGA module: Basic Sorting Algorithms](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/778)
1. [In-class Lesson: Intro to Sorting](https://git.generalassemb.ly/seir-1213/intro-to-sorting-lesson) - Tomorrow's activity!

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this assignment, you will be able to:

**Introduction to Sorting Algorithms**
- Define the two sorting methods and when youâ€™d use each.
- Identify whether a sort is stable or unstable, and what impact that can have.
- Explain how Big O complexity applies to sorting algorithms.

**Basic Sorting Algorithms**
- Describe the time and space complexities of bubble and insertion sorts.
- Implement bubble and insertion sorts.

## Prerequisites
- Big O Notation
