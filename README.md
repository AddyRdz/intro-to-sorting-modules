# Intro to Sorting Algorithms

## Overview

This lesson is an introduction to the concept of sorting in computer science,
including sorting methods, stability, and how Big O comes into play for sorting.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Define the two sorting methods and when youâ€™d use each.
- Identify whether a sort is stable or unstable, and what impact that can have.
- Explain how Big O complexity applies to sorting algorithms.

## Prerequisites

- Big O Notation

## Activity 

There are a few components to this lesson, in the following order:

1. [myGA module: Intro to Sorting Algorithms](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/818?from=dashboard&assignmentUuid=4cdfc361-13c8-48ec-9e6f-8ac374151e7f)
1. [myGA module: Basic Sorting Algorithms (Focus on Bubble Sort, you will do Insertion Sort tomorrow!)]() 
2. [In-Class Exercise: Try to Write a Bubble Sort Algorithm](./bubblesort.js)
  - To do this in class exercise, make sure you...
    1. Fork and clone this repository to your local machine 
    1. `cd` into this repository via terminal and do your work in the `bubblesort.js` file
